# Rise pool distribution software
This software is created by Rise delegate "dakk" for Lisk and modified for use with Rise by Aetsen, please consider a small donation if you
use this software: "2324852447570841050L" for lisk or "7725849364280821971S" for shift.


## Configuration
Fork this repo; edit risepool.py and modify the first lines with your settings:

- PUBKEY: your delegate pubkey
- PERCENTAGE: percentage to distribute
- SECRET: your secret
- SECONDSECRET: your second secret or none if disabled
- NODE: the rise node where you get forging info
- NODEPAY: the rise node used for payments
- MINPAYOUT: the minimum amount for a payout

Now edit docs/index.html and customize the webpage.

Finally edit poollogs_example.json and put in lastpayout the unixtimestamp of your last payout or the
date of pool starting; move poollogs_example.json to poollogs.json.


## Running it

First install requests:

`pip3 install requests`

Then start it:

`python3 risepool.py`

It produces a file "payments.sh" with all payments shell commands. Run this file with:

`bash payments.sh`

The payments will be broadcasted (every 10 seconds). At the end you can move your generated
poollogs.json to docs/poollogs.json and send the update to your git repo.

To display the pool frontend, enable docs-site on github repository settings.


## Batch mode

The script is also runnable by cron using the -y argument:

`python3 risepool.py -y`

There is also a 'batch.sh' file which run risepool, then payments.sh and copy the poollogs.json
in the docs folder.
